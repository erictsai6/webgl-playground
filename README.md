Playground to mess around with BabylonJS

## Troubleshooting
I had issues trying to use the ES6 modules because of the side effects so I fell back on the `babylonjs` npm module instead.  This does not allow for proper tree-shaking but at least it is functional.

I added in a .bak file to keep track of things I experimented with.
